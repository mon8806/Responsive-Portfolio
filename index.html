        <p>Born and raised in Seattle. Graduated from UW but still trying to figure what I wanted to do with my life. A year
            later I enrolled in pastry school. I interned in France for 3 months after I graduated. Been baking for the past
            8 years. What I loved about baking is the creativity of it but it's not as challenging as it was in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p> I have a lot of different of hobbies and it all revolves my creativity. My husband suggested I try coding. I started
            learning on my own and I found that it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Just a lot of memorization. It
            still is challenging but it's what I'm looking for that also incorpates my creativity.
        </p>
        <p>I'm excited for this new journey. I know it's going to be tough but I won't give up.
